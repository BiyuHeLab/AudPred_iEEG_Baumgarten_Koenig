# Project Description: NASTD_ECoG

Project: Natural Auditory Sequences _ Tone Duration (NASTD) - ECoG STudy
Experimenter: Thomas J. Baumgarten

Project Description: Natural auditory tone sequences with naturalistic stimulus statistics presented to ECoG patients;
Follow-up project of 
    1) Maniscalco et al. (2018) JNS - INtroduction of stimuli, core analyses
    2) NASTD_MEG -
Task: Rate likelihood of final tone pitch, depending on tone sequence information.
Analyses:
    - Behavioral: Assess effect of predicted final tone pitch (p*34) on final tone pitch likelihood rating
    - History Tracking: Investigate neural activity as function of previously presented tone pitches
    - Prediction: Investigate neural activity at semi-final tone (p33) as function of predicted final tone pitch (p*34)
    - Prediction error:  Linearly regress neural activity at presented final tone (p34) on the difference between presented final tone (p34) and predicted final tone pitch (p*34)
